# Set up a list that will contain all RxCUI numbers to be cross referenced

# Start a loop to prompt user for their drug names
    # Prompt user for a drug name
    # If a drug name come back with an RxCUI number, add it to the list
    # Else, print an error message (misspelling, or maybe just not in the database, etc.)
    # Prompt the user asking if they're done
    # If yes, break the while loop

# Once RxCUI numbers are in the list, start iterating through the list and check for references of all other drugs in the list
    # If a reference is found, print out the warning description
