Welcome to Cura! 
Cura is a program intended to help catch and prevent interactions between medications. It is not a replacement for 
medical care or communicating with your medical provider rather it is a tool to ensure you are as informed as possible 
on your medical care. Cura allows a user to input their current medications and checks for any possible interactions. 
If the program finds an interaction, it will alert the user and advise them to speak with their medical provider. If no 
interactions are found, then Cura let's the user know it found 0 interactions. 

Disclaimer:
It is not this programs intention to provide specific medical advice, but rather to provide users with information to 
better understand their health and their medications. You should consult with a qualified physician for advice about 
medications.
